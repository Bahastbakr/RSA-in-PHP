To use:
=======
$text = "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers";
$RSA = new RSA_Handler();
$keys = $RSA->generate_keypair(1024);
$encrypted = $RSA->encrypt($text, $keys[0]);
$decrypted = $RSA->decrypt($encrypted, $keys[1]);
echo $decrypted; //Will print Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers

Changelog
=========
Version 2.1: The code is now more efficient, and uses number of bits to determine key sizes (instead of number of digits).

Version 2.0: I have updated the code! It is now 100% portable and full functioning. The only thing I have left out is the ability to encrypt the private key, but there are several pure PHP implementations of AES, DES3, Blowfish etc. which can be used to encrypt a private key for storage.

Version 1 (initial release): I didnâ€™t really make these classes to be portable, so in the RSA_Handler class, there are a few things that I did my own way (mostly in the generate_keys and encrypt functions). For the most basic usage, use an RSA_keymaker object and the make_keys function. The function will return an array of keys (in number form) where $keys[0] is the public key, $keys[1] is the private key and $keys[2] is the modulo. The keys generated with the default function are around 1024 bits (a 310 digit modulo).
